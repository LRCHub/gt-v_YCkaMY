Three, two, one
Come on!

Scattered memories, emotions and what
Have you penetrated all of my woes
I left a grudge for the love of a selfish somebody
To kick me out on my own

But you ain't got a clue what it's like
To be alone and vulnerable you whole damn life
Let loose and scream it out "That's not right!"

Got fury! Right now
Bad guys, get outta my way
Tough love, punish everyone
I'm not even tired, tired, tired
No, I'm not gonna cry, nah, bye now!
Take that fury! Right now
Bad guys, knock 'еm out dead
Tough love
Leads this hеart to what I want
I'm not tired, tired, tired
I'm not lonely, I'm fine, yeah, blind ya
Backlight!

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

Picturesque suffering ain't really what
Ya would expect far as bad ends go
Internal heat, heart is beating with red hot coloring
Lacking a definite end
Blurry eyes from the unending crying
Finding beauty in it's all that I know
Hypnotized by their lies under crimson lighting
Against the sun at my back

Emotions tangled up inside this heart
I get that now or so I say
Impatient phrases had me from the start
With edges frayed

Got fury! Right now
Bad guys, get outta my way
Tough love, punish everyone
I'm not even tired, tired, tired
No, I'm not gonna cry, nah, bye now!
Take that fury! Right now
Bad guys, knock 'em out dead
Tough love
Leads this heart to what I want
I'm not tired, tired, tired
I'm not lonely, I'm fine, yeah, blind ya
Backlight!

Oh, back then I was dead-set on praying you down
Those words have since crumbled into the ground
But now, the after-shocks of rage linger
But you know, I'm tired of repeating myself alone
'Cause you never listened, since then I've grown
Up and yet, these dreams in my head
Get more painful by the second

Got fury! Again!!
Bad guys, knock 'em out dead
Tough love, punish everyone
I'm not even tired, tired, tired
No, I'm not gonna cry, nah, bye now!
Got this fury! Now!!
Bad guys, get outta my way
Tough love
Leads this heart to what I want
I'm not tired, tired, tired
I'm not lonely, I'm fine, yeah, blind ya
Backlight!
